the .dll files inthe "32bit" folder are the original .dll files that came with the tesseract download.

the .dll files currently in the "tesseract" folder are 64bit versions downloaded from https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/tree/master/src/lib/TesseractOcr/x64

furthemore, "gsdll4.dll" had to be downloaded from GPL Ghostscript so that pdf files could be read http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/files

but no worries, everything is still under open source licenses :)
